 Hi

I am a PhD student in  [Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech where I am employed as a  graduate research assistant and supervised by [Harpreet S. Dhillon](http://www.dhillon.ece.vt.edu/). My research interest focuses on modeling and analysis of heterogeneous cellular networks using the tools of stochastic geometry and the theory of point processes. Prior to joining [Wireless@VT](https://wireless.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech, I completed my BE in Electrical and Telecommunication Engineering at [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/), India. I have held summer internship position in Department of Electrical Engineering in National University of Technology (NUS), Singapore. Apart from my wireless communications, I love to spend my leisure on reading about photography and experimenting my camera.
