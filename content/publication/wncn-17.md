abstract = "In this paper we develop a comprehensive analytical framework for a cellular network enhanced with in-band device-to-device (D2D) communication capability where the D2D links reuse the downlink resources of the cellular links. The locations of the cellular base stations (BSs) are modeled as a Poisson point process (PPP). The user positions are modeled as a Thomas cluster process (TCP) to capture the inherent tendency of users to be located at close proximity to each other. The bandwidth allocated to D2D transmission is fixed and to cellular transmission is dynamic dependent on the load (the number of users) served by the macro BS. The users inside a cluster can either establish a D2D connection with a potential D2D transmitter (Tx) containing the file of interest within the same cluster if it is located closer than certain distance threshold or otherwise connects to the cellular network. By increasing this distance threshold, cellular traffic can be offloaded to D2D connections which in turn increases the interference from simultaneously active D2D Txs. We characterize the downlink rate coverage probability for this setup. Our analysis shows that there exists an optimum distance threshold for which rate coverage is maximized."
